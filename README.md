Instruction:

- You just need to go to the /deploy directory and then use docker-compose up --build command. That's it!
After it you can go to the localhost:8080 page and use the project.

It's the first version and I can add some updates later.

Also you can check my YouTube clannel with videos about this project and some other projects: https://www.youtube.com/@krokoq1
